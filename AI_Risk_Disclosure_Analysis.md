## AI-Specific Risk Categories (Emerging Practice)

Based on our analysis of disclosure patterns, AI companies should consider the following risk categories:

### 1. Model Performance & Reliability
- **Current practice:** Rarely disclosed with specificity
- **Best practice:** Quantify accuracy metrics, describe testing methodology, disclose known limitations

### 2. Training Data & IP
- **Current practice:** Generic IP risk language
- **Best practice:** Describe training data provenance, licensing arrangements, pending IP claims

### 3. Regulatory Compliance
- **Current practice:** Forward-looking generic statements
- **Best practice:** Enumerate specific regulations (EU AI Act, state laws), quantify compliance costs

### 4. AI Safety & Ethics
- **Current practice:** Emerging disclosure area
- **Best practice:** Describe governance framework, human oversight mechanisms, incident response

### 5. Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Current practice:** Supply chain risk mentioned generically
- **Best practice:** Quantify GPU/compute concentration, describe cloud provider dependencies

## Recommendations for S-1 Filers

1. **Be specific, not generic** - Avoid boilerplate risk language that could apply to any technology company
2. **Quantify where possible** - Include dollar amounts for compliance costs, compute spending, remediation timelines
3. **Address known incidents** - If model failures or content moderation issues occurred, disclose them
4. **Update for regulatory developments** - Reference specific regulations (EU AI Act, state AI laws)
5. **Coordinate with technical teams** - Risk disclosures should reflect actual capabilities and limitations
