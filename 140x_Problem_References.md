## Methodology Notes

### Keyword Taxonomy

The analysis employed 35 AI-related keywords derived from three sources:

1. MIT AI Risk Repository (risk categories)
2. NIST AI Risk Management Framework (governance terms)
3. Legal scholarship on AI disclosure requirements (regulatory terms)

Keywords were classified as:
- **Generic terms**: "artificial intelligence," "machine learning," "AI," "LLM," "compute," "GPU," "data center"
- **Specific risk terms**: "hallucination," "bias," "training data," "model accuracy," "human oversight," "AI safety," "EU AI Act"

### Specificity Score Calculation

Specificity Score = Sum of mentions across specific risk categories (cat_ai_risk, cat_ai_regulation, cat_mit4_malicious, cat_mit5_human, cat_mit6_socio, cat_mit6_environ, cat_mit7_safety)

### Generic Discloser Criteria

Companies classified as "Generic Disclosers" met both conditions:
1. Generic category mentions > 5
2. Specific category mentions = 0
