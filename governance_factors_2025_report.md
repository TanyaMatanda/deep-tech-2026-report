# Deep Tech Governance Analysis - 2026 Proxy Season

> **Status:** Real-World Data Analysis (US & Canada)
> **Date:** December 17, 2025
> **Scope:** Verified Real Public Companies (N=975)

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the governance profiles of **975 verified real-world Deep Tech companies** based on their latest SEC filings (DEF 14A).

### Key Findings (Real-World Cohort)
*   **Diversity:** Women hold an average of **12.0%** of board seats. Notably, **39.9%** of companies still have **zero women** on their boards.
*   **Technical Expertise:** Boards are technically literate, with an average of **3.6** directors possessing relevant technical or cybersecurity expertise.
*   **AI Governance:** Explicit "AI Oversight Committees" are extremely rare (**0.1%**), suggesting that AI oversight is likely subsumed under broader Technology or Audit committees rather than standalone bodies.
*   **Data Gaps:** "Board Chair Gender" data is currently unavailable due to pending schema updates.

## 1. Board Diversity (Gender)

*Representation of women on boards (US Cohort).*

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Average Women %** | **12.0%** |
| **Companies with Zero Women** | **39.9%** |
| **Gender Parity (>=50%)** | **0.3%** |

> **Observation:** While some leaders like **Merck** and **Bristol Myers Squibb** approach parity, a significant portion of the Deep Tech sector lags behind, with nearly 40% of boards lacking female representation entirely.

## 2. Technical Expertise

*Presence of specialized skills (Cybersecurity, Technology, Digital).*

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Avg Tech Experts per Board** | **3.6** |
| **Max Tech Experts** | **7.0** |

> **Insight:** The high average of technical experts suggests that Deep Tech boards are prioritizing domain knowledge, likely due to the complex nature of their products (biotech, semiconductors, AI).

## 3. AI Governance Oversight

*Presence of specialized oversight structures for Artificial Intelligence.*

| Metric | Status |
|---|---|
| **AI Oversight Committee** | **0.1%** (1 Company) |
| **AI Ethics Policy** | *Data Inconclusive* |

> **Note:** The low detection rate of explicit "AI Committees" indicates that governance is likely happening at the full board level or within existing Audit/Risk committees, rather than through specialized new structures.

## 4. Top Performers (Diversity & Expertise)

Companies leading in governance metrics:

| Company | Women % | Tech Experts |
|---|---|---|
| **Purdue Pharma LP** | 50.0% | 5 |
| **Univ Yale** | 50.0% | 5 |
| **Merck Sharp & Dohme** | 45.5% | 5 |
| **Bristol Myers Squibb** | 45.5% | 5 |

## Recommendations

1.  **Formalize AI Oversight:** Given the scarcity of dedicated AI committees, companies should explicitly charter their Audit or Risk committees with AI oversight responsibilities to ensure accountability.
2.  **Address Diversity Gaps:** The 40% of companies with zero women directors face reputational and cognitive diversity risks. Targeted recruitment is essential.
3.  **Schema Update:** Complete the manual schema update to enable tracking of **Board Chair Gender**, which remains a blind spot in this analysis.
