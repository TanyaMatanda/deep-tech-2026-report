## I. AI Model Performance & Reliability Risks

### A. Model Accuracy and Output Quality

**Sample Language:**

> *Our AI systems may produce inaccurate, biased, or harmful outputs that could damage our reputation, expose us to liability, and adversely affect our business.*
>
> Our products rely on artificial intelligence and machine learning models that generate outputs based on training data and algorithmic processes. These models may produce outputs that are inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or biased. We cannot guarantee that our AI systems will perform as expected in all circumstances, particularly in novel situations not well-represented in our training data.
>
> If our AI systems produce harmful, defamatory, infringing, or otherwise problematic outputs, we may face claims from customers, users, or third parties, regulatory scrutiny, reputational damage, and loss of customer confidence. The costs of addressing such issues could be substantial and may not be fully covered by insurance.

### B. AI "Hallucination" Risk

**Sample Language:**

> *Our large language models may generate false or fabricated information, which could harm users who rely on such outputs.*
>
> Large language models, including those we develop or incorporate into our products, may generate outputs that appear plausible but are factually incorrect—a phenomenon sometimes referred to as "hallucination." Users may rely on such outputs without independent verification, potentially leading to adverse consequences including financial loss, physical harm, or legal liability.
>
> We implement safeguards designed to reduce hallucination risk, but these safeguards may not be effective in all cases. We cannot predict all circumstances in which our models may produce unreliable outputs, and the occurrence of significant hallucination events could materially harm our business and reputation.

---

## II. Data & Training Risks

### A. Training Data Provenance

**Sample Language:**

> *We may face claims that our AI models were trained on data obtained without proper authorization, which could result in significant legal liability and remediation costs.*
>
> Our AI models are trained on large datasets that may include content created by third parties. Although we employ processes to identify and address potential intellectual property concerns in our training data, these processes may not identify all potentially problematic content. Third parties have asserted, and may continue to assert, that our training practices infringe their copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.
>
> The legal framework governing AI training on third-party content is evolving and uncertain. If courts or regulators determine that our training practices require additional licensing or consent, or constitute infringement, we may be required to pay substantial damages, obtain licenses on unfavorable terms, retrain our models (which could cost [$ ] and take [ ] months), or discontinue certain products. Any of these outcomes could materially harm our business.

### B. Data Privacy Compliance

**Sample Language:**

> *Our AI systems process personal data subject to complex and evolving privacy regulations, and compliance failures could result in significant penalties and reputational harm.*
>
> Our AI products collect, process, and generate outputs that may include personal information subject to privacy regulations including GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and other data protection laws. These regulations impose restrictions on data processing, require specific consent mechanisms, and grant individuals rights regarding their personal data.
>
> We have implemented privacy compliance measures, but the intersection of privacy law and AI technology is uncertain and evolving. Regulators may determine that certain AI processing activities require additional disclosures, consents, or safeguards that we have not implemented. Privacy enforcement actions, class action litigation, or regulatory fines could result in material costs and adversely affect our ability to operate our AI products in certain jurisdictions.

---

## III. Regulatory & Legal Risks

### A. Evolving AI Regulation

**Sample Language:**

> *The regulatory landscape for AI is rapidly evolving, and new laws or regulations could require significant changes to our products or business practices.*
>
> Governments worldwide are considering or implementing regulations specifically addressing artificial intelligence. The European Union's AI Act imposes risk-based requirements on AI systems that may apply to our products. The United States is developing AI governance frameworks through executive action and potential legislation. Other jurisdictions are considering their own AI regulatory approaches.
>
> We cannot predict the final form of AI regulations or their application to our business. Compliance with new AI regulations could require significant expenditure, product modifications, operational changes, or geographic restrictions on our products. Failure to comply could result in penalties, product bans, or litigation that materially harms our business.

### B. AI Liability Uncertainty

**Sample Language:**

> *Legal frameworks for AI liability are uncertain, and we may face claims under novel legal theories or expanded interpretations of existing law.*
>
> Courts and regulators are developing new approaches to liability for AI systems. We may face claims alleging negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, or other theories arising from the performance of our AI products. The allocation of liability between AI developers, deployers, and users is uncertain and may be resolved in ways unfavorable to us.
>
> We may also face claims that our AI systems engaged in unlawful discrimination, violated consumer protection laws, or caused other legally cognizable harms. Defending against such claims could be expensive regardless of their merit, and adverse judgments could establish precedents that materially expand our exposure to future claims.

---

## IV. Competition & Technology Risks

### A. Rapid Technological Change

**Sample Language:**

> *The AI industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and our competitive position depends on our ability to continue developing innovative AI capabilities.*
>
> Advances in AI technology occur rapidly and are often unpredictable. Competitors with greater resources, including well-funded technology companies and growing startups, may develop AI capabilities that render our products obsolete or less competitive. Open-source AI development may reduce barriers to entry and commoditize certain AI capabilities.
>
> Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain AI talent, access sufficient computing resources, and continue developing differentiated AI products. If we fail to keep pace with technological developments, our competitive position and financial performance could suffer materially.

### B. Concentration in AI Infrastructure

**Sample Language:**

> *We depend on a limited number of suppliers for critical AI infrastructure, and disruptions to these relationships could materially harm our business.*
>
> Our AI development and deployment depends on specialized computing chips (primarily from NVIDIA), cloud computing services (primarily from [AWS/Azure/GCP]), and other infrastructure components sourced from a limited number of suppliers. These suppliers may be unable to meet our demand, may increase prices, or may prioritize other customers.
>
> Supply chain disruptions, geopolitical restrictions on semiconductor trade, or deterioration of our supplier relationships could limit our ability to train and deploy AI models, increase our costs, or delay product development. We may be unable to obtain alternative infrastructure on comparable terms or establish new supplier relationships quickly enough to avoid material business impact.

---

## V. Governance & Control Risks

### A. AI Safety and Alignment

**Sample Language:**

> *We may be unable to ensure that our AI systems operate safely and in alignment with intended purposes, which could result in unintended harms.*
>
> As AI systems become more capable, ensuring that they operate safely and in alignment with intended purposes becomes more challenging. Our AI systems may behave unpredictably in certain circumstances, pursue objectives in unintended ways, or be subject to manipulation by malicious actors.
>
> We invest in AI safety research and implement safeguards intended to maintain human oversight and control over our AI systems. However, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent all safety incidents, and the consequences of a significant AI safety failure could include harm to individuals, regulatory action, reputational damage, and material liability.

### B. Dual-Use Concerns

**Sample Language:**

> *Our AI technology could be misused for harmful purposes, which could expose us to reputational harm, regulatory action, or legal liability.*
>
> AI technology, including technology we develop, may be capable of applications that could cause significant harm if misused. These applications could include generating disinformation, enabling surveillance, facilitating cyberattacks, or other harmful uses we have not anticipated.
>
> We implement usage policies and technical safeguards intended to prevent misuse of our AI products, but these measures may not be effective against determined bad actors. Public perception that our technology is being used for harmful purposes could damage our reputation and customer relationships. Governments may impose restrictions on AI capabilities or applications that limit our business opportunities.

## VI. Financial & Operational Risks

### A. AI Development Costs

**Sample Language:**

> *Developing and operating AI systems requires substantial and increasing capital expenditure, and our costs may exceed our expectations or available resources.*
>
> Training large AI models requires significant computing resources that represent a substantial portion of our expenses. Computing costs for AI development and deployment have increased substantially and may continue to increase. We anticipate needing to make capital expenditures of approximately $[  ] over the next [  ] fiscal years to maintain our competitive position.
>
> These investments may not yield expected returns on a timeline acceptable to investors, or at all. If we are unable to fund necessary AI development activities from operating cash flow, financing, or other sources, our ability to compete and our financial performance could be materially impaired.

### B. Key Personnel Dependence

**Sample Language:**

> *Our success depends on retaining key AI research and engineering personnel in a highly competitive talent market.*
>
> Competition for qualified AI professionals is intense, and we compete for talent with technology companies and well-funded startups that may offer greater compensation, equity, or other inducements. Our AI development depends on a limited number of key technical personnel, and the loss of these individuals could significantly impair our research progress and product development.
>
> We may be unable to replace departing personnel with individuals of comparable skill and experience. Increases in compensation necessary to retain key employees could materially increase our operating expenses.

## Best Practices for AI Risk Disclosure

### 1. **Be Specific, Not Generic**
Avoid boilerplate language that could apply to any company. Describe your actual AI capabilities, training approaches, and risk mitigation measures.

### 2. **Quantify Where Possible**
Include specific dollar amounts, timeframes, and metrics where available (e.g., training costs, remediation timelines, insurance coverage limits).

### 3. **Address Known Incidents**
If you have experienced AI-related incidents (model failures, content moderation issues, data breaches), disclose them and your remediation steps.

### 4. **Update for Regulatory Developments**
AI regulation is evolving rapidly. Ensure disclosures reflect current regulatory posture in key jurisdictions (EU AI Act, state AI laws, etc.).

### 5. **Coordinate with Technical Teams**
Risk disclosures should be informed by actual technical capabilities and limitations. Involve AI engineers and researchers in the disclosure drafting process.

## Recent SEC Enforcement Trends

- **Specificity requirements:** SEC has criticized generic risk factors that fail to describe company-specific circumstances
- **Forward-looking statements:** AI capability claims must have reasonable basis; avoid overpromising on future AI performance
- **Cybersecurity integration:** AI security risks should be coordinated with broader cybersecurity disclosures under new SEC rules
- **ESG considerations:** Some AI risks (bias, environmental impact of compute) may warrant ESG disclosure treatment
